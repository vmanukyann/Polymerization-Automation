# Polymerization-Automation
 
This project if meant for web scrapping data from PolyInfo onto a google sheet. All three files work similarly. They all have certain links to click on and find specific values on the website. However, PolyInfo does not allow automation. So instead, the program takes a screenshot of the information needed, translates it into characters, deletes the screenshot, and paste onto the sheet. In addition, JS is halted when the program is run to prevent CAPTCHA from running.
